    <h1> One Piece </h1>
    <p> <b>One Piece</b> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump 
        since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 106 tankōbon volumes as of July 2023. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.
        The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei 
        has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media,
        such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before 
        the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by <b>Funimation in 2007</b></p>

    <h1><b>Synopis</b></h1>
    <p>
        The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants,
         merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as "Minks").
          The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. 
          The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals.
           There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government,
            the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World 
            Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also an
            y individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enh
        anced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.
